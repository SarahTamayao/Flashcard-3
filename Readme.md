## Flashcard App


## Lab 1

### App Description
This flashcard app that was created displays a question to the user and allows them to tap on the card in order to display the correct answer. An additional feature that was included was multiple choice options that prompted the user to select the correct answer for the question. If the choice selected was incorrect, the button would simply disappear, however if it was correct the card would switch to display the answer.
