## Lab 2

### App Description
This builds upon the previous Flashcard lab, which displayed a question and three multiple choice options for the answer to the user. The user was permitted to toggle back and forth between the question and the answer when it is clicked on. For this lab, the user was prompted to hit the (+) button to create a new card. If the question and answer fields are left blank and the "Done" button is clicked, an error message will appear. The user can then click "Cancel" to return to the original card. The user can edit the flashcard using the edit button, which is denoted by "✏️". This allows them to type a new question and three multiple choice options for a new card.
